## 📝 Project Summary

This project focuses on performing in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a combined dataset of movies and TV shows derived from `titles.csv` and `credits.csv`. The goal is to understand trends and patterns in content types, genres, runtime, popularity, and ratings across different years and platforms. We merged both datasets using a common identifier (`id`) and generated valuable insights using only four Python libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`.

The analysis follows a structured approach:
- **Univariate Analysis** to understand individual variables like genres, runtime, release year.
- **Bivariate Analysis** to discover relationships between numerical and categorical variables.
- **Multivariate Analysis** for deeper storytelling with multiple dimensions.
- Data wrangling and cleaning ensured accuracy and consistency.
- 20+ charts were created to derive actionable business insights.

Key findings reveal shifts in content production trends, dominant genres over the years, relationships between popularity and IMDb ratings, and insights on runtime and certification. These insights can help OTT platforms, production studios, and media analysts make data-driven decisions.
